ECO --> Encyclopedia of Chess Openings.

The Alekhine Defense is a semi-open opening planned after the movement: pawn e4, knight f6.
In this opening, one side tries to avoid playing pawns on the center, not giving the oponent the posibility to attack. In contrast, it tries to eliminate the central pawns of the
oponent, forcing them to defend or move forward in a early fase of the opening, so it tries to weaken the oponent acquiring advantage. This is a sharp opening, but due to it's 
restrcited play, it is a play little seen on tournaments.
